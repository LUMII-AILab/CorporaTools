It seems, that PML toolkit (pmltk) uses some modules from TrEd itself and probably something from TrEd package EasyTreex, too. To get everything working, correct paths must be set in perl @INC. It can be done either using perl -I /path/to/lib or by setting enviroment variable PERL5LIB or PERLLIB. (Windows)

No idea, why PML Toolkit kniter has a problem with $VERSION variable - only thing I managed to figure out was to change the source code to avoid using this variable. This is the only difference between this version of PML Toolkit and pmltk-1.1.5. distributed by UFAL.
