ABSTRACT

  PML, which stands for "Prague Markup Language", is an XML-based,
  universally applicable data format based on abstract data types
  intended primarily for interchange of linguistic annotations.

  This package contains the specification and basic toolkit for the PML
  format.

	formats/cac         - Czech Academic Treebank

  Other PML formats:

	formats/pml_schema_tree - conversion of PML schema to a PML instance
	formats/tree_generic    - basic schema to derive specific
                                  treebank schemata from
	formats/parallel        - schema and support for parallel treebanks
	formats/any_xml         - convert arbitrary XML to PML and back

  Perl API for PML:

	libs/fslib/Fslib.pm          - handle tree-based data in various formats

  RelaxNG grammars for PML:

	rng/pml_schema.rng        - RelaxNG grammar for PML schema (all versions)
	rng/pml_schema_inline.rng - RelaxNG grammar for PML schema embedded in a PML instance

	rng/pml_common.rng        - auxiliary grammar included by
	                            grammars generated by pml2rng.xsl
	rng/pml_internal.rng      - ditto

  Auxiliary tools:
	tools/dtd2pml.pl       - convert any DTD to a PML schema
	tools/pml2rng.xsl   - convert PML schema to a RelaxNG grammar
	tools/pml2pls.btred - create a binary dump of a PML document
	                      for faster loading by Fslib
	tools/pml_simplify.xsl - XSLT 2.0 implementation of pml_simplify

	tools/foreach_match.pl - search PML instances using attribute paths
	tools/pml_rw.pl        - read/write PML instances (perl API testing tool)
	tools/knit.pl      - read PML instance and save it keeping in all
	                     material embedded via the #KNIT role

	tools/msv          - shell wrapper around MSV (Sun's Multi-Schema Validator)
	tools/relames      - shell wrapper around the Relames RNG validator
	tools/rng_validate - a RNG validator combining xmllint and jing
