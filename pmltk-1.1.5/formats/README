This directory contains PML support for various formats and treebanks.
Some of the subdirectories are TrEd extensions.

Most subdirectories in this directory are organized as follows (of
course, some subdirectories may be missing):

  bin/        - conversion and support scripts
  resources/  - PML schemata and XSLT stylesheets
  package.xml - TrEd extension description file
  contrib/    - TrEd extension code
  libs/       - Perl libraries
  doc/        - basic documentation

All conversion scripts are self-documenting via the --usage, --help
and sometimes --man command-line option.
