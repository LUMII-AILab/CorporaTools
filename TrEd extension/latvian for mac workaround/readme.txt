If standard input methods fail to give Latvian symbols, copy xmodmap.darwin given here to replace the one located in tred/tredlib. Depending on where TrEd is installed on your computer, tred/tredlib is found in /Applications or /opt or /Users/_your_username_. Make back-up copy of the original xmodmap.darwin beforehand! To get Latvian symbols, hold right Alt.
